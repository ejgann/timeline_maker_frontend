JS/Rails Order of Operations Guide (FRONTEND)
The JavaScript Project repo has a handful of helpful READMEs that outline the requirements for the JS/Rails Project along with project planning tips and a note about what to expect during your review. There is also this JavaScript Rails API Project Setup README that provides a thorough step by step walkthrough to get your project up and running along with some help OOJS refactoring tips. Lastly, we also wanted to outline a suggested flow of execution to aide you in building your project. We put together this "Order of Operations Guide" for organizing and completing your JS/Rails Project. This guide is based on the 4-part project build. All study groups can be found here.

The application we will create during the project build series is a "Syllabus Sharing App" for independent study.

USER STORY: A user should be able to read and create syllabi based on category

Checklist
PART 1: Planning and Building a Rails API
BEFORE YOU CODE

 1. Check project requirements in JavaScript READMEs
 2. Ideate! What do you want to build?
choose a domain you're familiar with!
choose a domain you care about
 3. Wireframing & User Stories
Write down your models, their attributes, and their associations
"As a user, I can ....."
"A user should be able to ....."
What does your app do?
 4. Design your MVP = 'Minimum Viable Product' vs. what are my 'stretch goals'
Stretch goals - bonus features you want but don't need
NOW WE'RE READY FOR PROJECT SET UP

 5. Generate new Rails API using rails new <my_app_name> --database=postgresql --api
(Replace <my_app_name> with the actual name of your project)
 6. Create github repo
 7. Create a new branch for building out models git co -b <branch_name>. This way you can always go back to the fresh API.
NOTE: It is best practice to always create a new branch when working on a new feature/edit to your code. Your master branch should only have working code. Debug in a branch, not in master.
NOW WE'RE READY TO CODE (BUT JUST OUR MODELS â€” NO CONTROLLERS OR SERIALIZERS YET)

NOTE: Remember to VERTICALLY build your MVP! This means building out one model/feature at a time. DO NOT build out all the models and controllers at the same time. This is the easiest way to get lost in your project very early. Read more about this here.

 8. Build your models: rails g model <your_model_name> name (Make sure you capitalize the first letter of the model name!)
Migrations
Model classes
Associations
 9. Test your models and associations in the console
Create some seed data
Adjust migrations as needed
PART 2: Routes, Controllers, Serializers
 1. Routes

Implement specific namespaced routes for a controller for MVP

REMEMBER! We're trying to build vertically.

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      resources :syllabuses, only: [:index, :create]
    end
  end
end
Run rails routes to confirm routes

Visit http://localhost:3000/api/v1/<your_resource_name> to see error

 2. Controllers

In your console run: rails g controller api/v1/<your controller_name> (Make sure you capitalize and the first letter of the controller name!)
Build relevant routes for MVP (ex: index and create)
Visit http://localhost:3000/api/v1/<your_resource_name> to see JSON data
 3. Fast JSON API Serializer

Add gem 'fast_jsonapi' to your Rails project's Gemfile and run bundle install
Create Serializer classes
rails g serializer <your_resource_name>
rails g serializer <your_resource_name>
Update Controller Actions
class Api::V1::SyllabusesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @syllabuses = Syllabus.all
    # render json: @syllabuses
    render json: SyllabusSerializer.new(@syllabuses)
  end
end
Adding Attributes
class SyllabusSerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :title, :description, :image_url, :category_id
end
Accessing Associations (Related Objects)
class SyllabusSerializer
  include FastJsonapi::ObjectSerializer
  attributes :title, :description, :image_url, :category_id, :category
end
Adding Relationships
To control the attributes displayed in the association view PART 2 notes on adding relationships
 4. TEST: Confirm data at your Rails endpoints! (ex: http://seeda.com/api/v1/syllabuses)

 5. Build out your associated models using this same process. REMEMBER: Focus on building vertically for MVP this means only starting with 2 or 3 models before moving on to the frontend.

PART 3: DOM Manipulation, Events, and Fetch using Rails API
JS MANTRA: When some event happens, I want to make what kind of fetch and then manipulate the DOM in what way?

Quick note on frontend JS project design can be found in PART 3 notes.

Initial Setup

 1. Create separate directory for frontend
 2. Create index.html file with script tag connecting your index.js. Ex: <script type="text/javascript" src="index.js"></script>
 3. Create index.js, console.log("in index.js"), and check for the logged message in your dev tools to confirm the index.html <> index.js connection was established.
 4. Initialize a git repo for frontend repository.
Connect your API to your frontend!

 5. Think about the JS mantra and answer this question: When the DOM Content is Loaded, I want to make a GET fetch and then manipulate the DOM in what way (usually render the data)?
 6. Create DOMContentLoaded event listener and console.log("loaded") as the event handler to confirm we've properly set up the listener.
 7. We're eventually going to make a call to the index route of our API (ex: localhost:3000/api/v1/syllabuses). Run your rails server and visit that end point in the browser to confirm the expected JSON data is present.
 8. We can see the JSON data in the browser but in order to access it in our frontend, we'll need to setup Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). In order to do this we'll need to do a couple things:
Navigate to your Gemfile and uncomment gem 'rack-cors' then bundle install. You can read more about CORS in the PART 3 notes and here.
Inside of config/initializers/cors.rb uncomment the CORS code and update origins 'example.com' to origins '*'
 9. Commit and push this code!
Receive (GET) data from the server

 10. GET request
Create a new branch for GET implementation.
Create your get____ function (ex: function getToys()) that will make a call to your index endPoint in your API, make your GET request inside the function and console.log the json data, then call your get___ function in the DOMContentLoaded event listener.
Once you have confirmed your GET request is returning the JSON you were expecting, use that data to update the DOM.(see PART 3 notes for example)
Once working: Commit and push this code! Then merge branch to master.
Submit (POST) data to the server

 11. POST request
Create a new branch for POST implementation.
Create form
Create submit event listener
Create submit event handler to handle form data
Create post_____ function
Manipulate the DOM with "posted" JSON data
Once working: Commit and push this code! Then merge branch to master.
 12. git pull on the master branch to get working GET and POST functionality.
Refactor to make your code more DRY

 13. Make sure you're not repeating yourself unnecessarily in your code. Ex: Create a render function you can use in both your "read" and "create" functions.
 14. Build out any additional features using the JS Mantra: Event, Fetch, and DOM Manipulation flow as a guide.
PART 4: OOJS Refactor
 1. IMPORTANT: Create a separate branch for your OOJS Refactor
 2. Create a JS Class (ex: class Syllabus)
 3. Link to the new JS file in your index.html (ex: <script type="text/javascript" src="src/syllabus.js"></script>)
 4. Create a constructor that pushes all instances of this into an empty array (See part 4 notes for example)
 5. Refactor render functionality by creating a render function in your JS class
 6. For future use, create a static method in your JS class that finds an object based on it's id. (In the PART 4 notes we see how this would be useful for 'update/PATCH' functionality)
Bonus
 Leverage a CSS framework to improve the styling of your application
Easiest to implement: Bulma
Most popular: Bootstrap
Also good: Semantic UI
Not bootstrap: Materialize
Confirm
 You have a large number of small Git commits
 Your commit messages are meaningful
 You made the changes in a commit that relate to the commit message
 You don't include changes in a commit that aren't related to the commit message
